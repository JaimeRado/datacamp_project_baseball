A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball. Use MLB's Statcast data to compare New York Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.

In this project, I will use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.
